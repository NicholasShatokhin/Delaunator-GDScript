# Delaunator GDScript ![Godot v3.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-v3.2-%23478cbf?logo=godot-engine&logoColor=white)

A GDScript port of Delaunator: A fast library for [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) of 2D points.

The original code is from [Mapbox's Delaunator](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator). Some reference code is from [Delaunator-Python](https://github.com/HakanSeven12/Delaunator-Python).

**Note**: It seems like GDScript is not that *fast* (in reference of the slogan above, taken from the original library). See the [performance benchmarks](#performance).

## Usage

```gdscript
const Delaunator = preload("res://Delaunator.gd")

var points = PoolVector2Array([
  Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(1024, 0), Vector2(1024, 600), Vector2(0, 600), Vector2(29, 390), Vector2(859, 300), Vector2(65, 342), Vector2(86, 333), Vector2(962, 212), Vector2(211, 351), Vector2(3, 594), Vector2(421, 278), Vector2(608, 271), Vector2(230, 538), Vector2(870, 454), Vector2(850, 351), Vector2(583, 385), Vector2(907, 480), Vector2(749, 533), Vector2(877, 232), Vector2(720, 546), Vector2(1003, 541), Vector2(696, 594), Vector2(102, 306)
])

## API Reference

### Delaunator.new(points)

Constructs a Delaunay triangulation object given an array of points (`Vector2(x, y)`). Duplicate points are skipped.

### Delaunator.new(points).triangles

An array of triangle vertex indices (each group of three numbers forms a triangle). All triangles are directed counterclockwise.

To get the coordinates of all triangles, use:

```gdscript
var coordinates = []

for i in range(0, triangles.size(), 3):
  coordinates.append([
    points[triangles[i]],
    points[triangles[i + 1]],
    points[triangles[i + 2]]
  ])
```

### Delaunator.new(points).halfedges

An array of triangle half-edge indices that allows you to traverse the triangulation.
`i`-th half-edge in the array corresponds to vertex `triangles[i]` the half-edge is coming from.
`halfedges[i]` is the index of a twin half-edge in an adjacent triangle (or `-1` for outer half-edges on the convex hull).

The flat array-based data structures might be counterintuitive, but they're one of the key reasons this library is fast.

### Delaunator.new(points).hull

An array of indices that reference points on the convex hull of the input data, counter-clockwise.

### Delaunator.new(points).coords

An array of input coordinates in the form `[x0, y0, x1, y1, ...]`, of the type provided in the constructor.

### Delaunator.new(points).update()

Updates the triangulation if you modified `Delaunator.new(points).coords` values in place, avoiding expensive memory allocations. Useful for iterative relaxation algorithms such as [Lloyd's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm).

## Performance

Benchmark results performed on a Macbook Pro Retina 15" 2015 with Godot v3.2 and using this method:

```gdscript
var start = OS.get_ticks_msec()
var delaunay = Delaunator.new(points)
var elapsed = OS.get_ticks_msec() - start
print(elapsed)
```
